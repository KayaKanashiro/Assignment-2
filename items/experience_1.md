## Tim Hortons Musical 

I was in Tim Hortons 60th anniversary musical.

It was this year from June to July.

My extremely talented cast members and the whole creative team.

The first day of being able to rehearse in the Elgin Winter Garden Theatres.

I did not enjoy how frequently the material would have to get altered or changed. On the day we opened, we had to change the ending of the show, it was very stressful.

Overall, I give my experience an A+ because I had the best time working in professional theatre for the first time.
