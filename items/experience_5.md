## Cottage Trip in Owen Sound
I went on a cottage trip with my friends from middle school.

This was at the end of August this year, just before second year started.

Getting to spend some quality time with my friends who all go to different universities. The air bnb we stayed in was super nice as well!

My favourite memory was going to Sauble beach and getting a smash burger there. It was the best burger I've ever eaten!

I didn't enjoy how cold and windy it was that weekend.

Overall, I give my experience a A because I made so many fun memories with my friends.
