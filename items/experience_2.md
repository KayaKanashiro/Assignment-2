## Sunnyside Bible Camp

I went to Sunnyside Bible Camp in Calgary, Alberta.

This happened this in late July this summer.

The whole church commmunity and my family that I got to spend time with! The community just felt like home.]

My favourite memory would have to be getting to lead for Late Night Worship.

I didn't enjoy saying goodbye to all my new friends and family when it was time to go home.

Overall, I give my experience an A+ because I made so many wonderful friends and memories I will cherish forever!
