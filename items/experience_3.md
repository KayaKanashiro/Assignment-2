## Wave To Earth Concert
I went to a Wave To Earth Concert!

I just went this last Sunday, October 27th 2024.

The band live was just as good as when I listen to them on streaming platforms.

My favourite memory has to be getting to hear their song "wave" live.

I did not enjoy how long I had to stand for. We bought general admission tickets so we ended up standing for around 7 hours straight.

Overall, I give my experience a B+ because the music was good but my legs and feet were in a lot of pain after.
