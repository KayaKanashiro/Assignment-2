## Summit '24
I went to Power To Change's fall retreat called Summit!

It was the last weekend of September 2024.

Getting to bond and connect with the other P2C students at Laurier through our love for Jesus!

My favourite memory was when we played in the volleyball intermurals and came second overall despite being the smallest campus and team there.

I did not enjoy how we got yelled at by the kitchen staff once during lunch because we forgot to put away our dishes before we got dessert.

I give my experience an A+ because I got to learn more about God and spend quality time with my P2C friends.
